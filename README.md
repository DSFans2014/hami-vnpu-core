# HAMi-vnpu-core —— Hook library for Ascend NPU
## Introduction
HAMi-vnpu-core is the in-container resource controller for Ascend NPU, written in Rust language.


## Features

HAMi-vnpu-core has the following features:
1. Virtualize device meory
2. Limit npu utilization by time shard

## Components
- **libvnpu.so (Interceptor + Manager)**: A dynamic library (`.so`) that intercepts NPU RTS API calls from AI frameworks to enforce constraints. On load it also spawns a lightweight **supervisor thread**. The supervisors of all processes in a Pod elect a single **Manager** that enforces the **Total Memory Quota** and **Compute Utilization** for that Pod. If the process hosting the manager exits or crashes, another process in the Pod automatically takes over. No separate daemon needs to be started.


## Prerequisites
- **NPU**: Ascend 910B.
- **Shared Region**: A host directory for coordination between pods (e.g., `/tmp/hami-shared-region`).
- **Toolchain**: Docker & Rust installed.

Please follow the instructions on the official Rust website to install rust:
**[https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/)**

## Build
Use `cargo` to build inside a environment with CANN installed.
```bash
cd hami-vnpu-core
cargo build
# build in release mode: cargo build --release
```

Artifacts Location:
- target/debug/**libvnpu.so**: The one and only artifact. It intercepts NPU calls AND hosts the manager (via an internal supervisor thread), so this is all you build and deploy.

## Deployment
### Host Environment preparation
Before launching any containers, the **Global Shared Memory (SHM) Region** must be initialized on the host to allow inter-Pod coordination.
Create the Shared Directory:
```
sudo mkdir -p /tmp/hami-shared-region
sudo chmod 777 /tmp/hami-shared-region
```
### Container Deployment
#### Step 1. Start Container
- When starting the container, you must map the following:
SHM Volume: Map the host's shared region (e.g.`/tmp/hami-shared-region`) to a container path (e.g., `/hami-shared-region`).
- Map `libvnpu.so` into the container.
- `--privileged` is required for Ascend NPUs to be shared between containers when start docker containers.

#### Step 2. Set Environment Variables:
- **NPU_GLOBAL_SHM_PATH**: Define a unique filename within the **shared region**.
> Note: You do NOT need to create this file manually; the manager (embedded in `libvnpu.so`) handles file creation and initialization. However, the path must be identical across all Pods to allow coordination.

- **NPU_MEM_QUOTA**: Memory limit for the specific Pod (in MB).

- **NPU_PRIORITY**: Set the scheduling priority (e.g., 20).

```bash
export NPU_GLOBAL_SHM_PATH="/hami-shared-region/global_registry"
export NPU_MEM_QUOTA=10240 # 10GB HBM
export NPU_PRIORITY=20 # use half of computing power than another one with priority 40
```

#### Step 3. Launching the AI App:
Just launch the AI application with the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable pointing to the `libvnpu.so` library. The manager starts automatically inside the library (there is no separate daemon to launch), and the app's NPU calls are routed through it.
```
LD_PRELOAD=./target/debug/libvnpu.so python3 your_model.py
```
