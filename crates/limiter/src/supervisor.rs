//! In-process manager supervisor.
//!
//! The manager daemon no longer runs as a separate binary. Instead every process
//! that loads `libvnpu.so` spawns a lightweight supervisor thread (see the ctor in
//! the `hook` crate). All supervisors in the same pod (same `NPU_LOCAL_SHM_PATH`)
//! race to become the *single* manager via a CAS on `LocalContainerShmem::manager_pid`.
//! The winner runs `ContainerManager::run()`; the losers stand by and watch, ready to
//! take over if the current manager dies. This guarantees exactly one manager per pod
//! while surviving crashes of whichever process happened to host it.
